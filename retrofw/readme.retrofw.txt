Default directories

==============================================================
* PAK files:         /home/retreofw/games/openbor/Paks
* Save files:        /home/retreofw/games/openbor/Saves
* Logs files:        /home/retreofw/games/openbor/Logs 
* Screenshot files:  /home/retreofw/games/openbor/ScreenShots 


Create a directory in /home/retreofw/games/openbor and create a Paks, Saves,Logs ScreenShot directory there as above

Put all your .pak in the Paks folder in 

/home/retreofw/games/openbor/Paks


Please note - games like he-man will not run in the correct resolution.

To fix this you need SDL2
